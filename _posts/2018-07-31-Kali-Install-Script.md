## Kali Linux Install Script
This is a custom script I created because I got tired of installing my tools manually! It's currently updated and maintained at https://github.com/dcarlin/Kali-Install-Script

Copy everything from #!/bin/bash and below, save it as a .sh file. Designed to run on Kali Linux after the initial ISO installation.
